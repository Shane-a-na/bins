It provides a high-level interface for creating informative and visually appealing statistical graphics. One of the most commonly used datasets in seaborn is the Titanic dataset, which contains information about the passengers aboard the Titanic during its ill-fated maiden voyage in 1912.\n","\n","The Titanic dataset is often used as a beginner's dataset for data exploration and visualization due to its relatively small size and comprehensible variables. It consists of various attributes about the passengers, such as their age, sex, ticket class, survival status, and more. This dataset is interesting to work with because it can offer insights into factors that influenced the passengers' chances of survival.\n","\n","To work with the Titanic dataset in seaborn, you typically load it as a pandas DataFrame and then use seaborn's functions to create visualizations based on the data. This can help you uncover patterns or trends in the data, such as the relationship between passenger class and survival rates or the distribution of ages among the passengers.\n","The Titanic dataset consists of several columns that provide information about the passengers aboard the Titanic. Here is an explanation of the column headings ommonly found in the Titanic dataset:\n","\n","PassengerId: A unique identifier for each passenger.\\\n","Survived: Indicates whether a passenger survived or not. This column has binary values: 0 for not survived and 1 for survived.\\\n","Pclass: Represents the passenger class or ticket class. It has three categories: 1 (first class), 2 (second class), or 3 (third class).\\\n","Sex: Indicates the gender of the passenger: male or female.\\\n","Age: The age of the passenger in years. It can contain fractional values if the age is estimated.\\\n","SibSp: The number of siblings or spouses aboard the Titanic for each passenger.\\\n","Parch: The number of parents or children aboard the Titanic for each passenger.\\\n","Fare: The fare or ticket price paid by the passenger.\\\n","Cabin: The cabin number or cabin letter where the passenger stayed.\\\n","Embarked: Represents the port of embarkation. It can take three values: C (Cherbourg), Q (Queenstown), or S (Southampton).\\\n","Class: Represent the passenger class in test form; first, second, third\\\n","who: represent sex as man/woman.\\\n","Adult_male: represents male sex as true/false\n","Deck: represent the deck assigned to passengers\n","Embark_town: represents the town of embarkation as a string.\\\n","Alive: survived or not.\\\n","Alone: True or false.\n","\n","These column headings provide information about various aspects of the passengers, such as their demographics (e.g., age, sex), socio-economic status (e.g., passenger class), family relationships (e.g., number of siblings/spouses and parents/children), and ticket details (e.g., fare, cabin, embarkation port).\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"w5kb-ljTiSDX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["##Preliminary Analysis titanic"],"metadata":{"id":"RvVo4op6nkqz"}},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"Ef53UXzNhuuo","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1689689773093,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":372,"user":{"displayName":"Dawn Carmichael","userId":"02789042846982841823"}},"outputId":"dfd751a8-679d-4fd1-cfd0-8faf9b814c41"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Shape (891, 15)\n","   survived  pclass     sex   age  sibsp  parch     fare embarked  class  \\\n","0         0       3    male  22.0      1      0   7.2500        S  Third   \n","1         1       1  female  38.0      1      0  71.2833        C  First   \n","2         1       3  female  26.0      0      0   7.9250        S  Third   \n","3         1       1  female  35.0      1      0  53.1000        S  First   \n","4         0       3    male  35.0      0      0   8.0500        S  Third   \n","\n","     who  adult_male deck  embark_town alive  alone  \n","0    man        True  NaN  Southampton    no  False  \n","1  woman       False    C    Cherbourg   yes  False  \n","2  woman       False  NaN  Southampton   yes   True  \n","3  woman       False    C  Southampton   yes  False  \n","4    man        True  NaN  Southampton    no   True  \n","\n","Describe for eligible columns\n","         survived      pclass         age       sibsp       parch        fare\n","count  891.000000  891.000000  714.000000  891.000000  891.000000  891.000000\n","mean     0.383838    2.308642   29.699118    0.523008    0.381594   32.204208\n","std      0.486592    0.836071   14.526497    1.102743    0.806057   49.693429\n","min      0.000000    1.000000    0.420000    0.000000    0.000000    0.000000\n","25%      0.000000    2.000000   20.125000    0.000000    0.000000    7.910400\n","50%      0.000000    3.000000   28.000000    0.000000    0.000000   14.454200\n","75%      1.000000    3.000000   38.000000    1.000000    0.000000   31.000000\n","max      1.000000    3.000000   80.000000    8.000000    6.000000  512.329200\n","Describe for single columnn - age \n"]},{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["count    714.000000\n","mean      29.699118\n","std       14.526497\n","min        0.420000\n","25%       20.125000\n","50%       28.000000\n","75%       38.000000\n","max       80.000000\n","Name: age, dtype: float64"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":64}],"source":["import seaborn as sns\n","import numpy\n","\n","df = sns.load_dataset('titanic')\n","print(\"Shape\", df.shape)\n","print(df.head(5))\n","print()\n","print(\"Describe for eligible columns\")\n","print(df.describe())\n","print()\n","print(\"Describe for single columnn - age \")\n","df.describe()[\"age\"]\n","\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Basics;
